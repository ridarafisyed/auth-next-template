# Next.js and MongoDB Authentication Template

Welcome to the Next.js and MongoDB authentication template! This template provides a starting point for building authentication functionality with Next.js on the frontend and MongoDB on the backend.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Allow users to register with a valid email, username, and password.
- **User Login:** Provide a secure login mechanism for registered users.
- **User Logout:** Allow users to log out of their accounts.
- **Protected Routes:** Implement protected routes that require authentication to access.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for building frontend applications.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database for storing user data.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for building backend services.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js.
- [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) - Authentication middleware for Node.js.
- [bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js/) - Library for hashing passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed or a MongoDB instance available.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-mongodb-auth-template.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs-mongodb-auth-template/frontend
   npm install

   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Set up your MongoDB database and obtain the connection URL.

2. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_url
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_url` with your MongoDB connection URL and `your_jwt_secret` with a secret key for JWT.

### Usage

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
